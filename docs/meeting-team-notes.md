## Description
This file contains all the meeting notes taken during our weekly meetings at **5:30 p.m. every Friday**.

### 12th September 2025
- Discussed the architecture to be presented to the client in the next meeting.  
- Patrick will prepare a clearer architecture plan.  
- Decided on project management tools:  
  - We will use **IoT Insight Tracker** on GitHub as our project management tool.  
  - Karen will create a `docs` (wiki) folder on GitHub to contain all our notes and documents.  
- Agreed to request a **laptop requisition** from the client in the next meeting, which will act as our server.  
- Decided to name our project **iota**.

### 16th September 2025
- Reviewed the architecture plan, discussed in details the different part of the architecture (IoT devices, server, database, preferred scenario, UI and how to connect all of them trough API calls).
- Patrick added all these details in the architecture.md file.
- We will meet tomorrow (17th September 2025) to access the lab and check the IoT devices available.
- Since the client is not available tomorrow, we will send an email with a link to the architecture.md file and ask for feedback.
- We can potentially work in parallel on different parts of the project (frontend using dummy data, backend using mock APIs & setting up the IoT devices) once the architecture is validated.
