# SEG4910-4911-capstone

# IoT Security and Analytics Platform

## üìñ Project Overview
This project aims to create an experimental IoT environment, both physical and simulated, where IoT devices can interact under normal operation as well as under attack scenarios.  
The generated dataset will include:
- Sensor readings  
- Network traffic logs  
- IDS (Intrusion Detection System) alerts  

A **Kibana-style dashboard** will be developed to visualize the data. Depending on progress, the project will also explore **ML/AI models** for anomaly detection and predictive analytics.
