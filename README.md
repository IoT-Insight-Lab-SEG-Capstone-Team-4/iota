# IoT Security and Analytics Platform

## üìñ Project Overview
This project aims to create an experimental IoT environment, both physical and simulated, where IoT devices can interact under normal operation as well as under attack scenarios.  
The generated dataset will include:
- Sensor readings  
- Network traffic logs  
- IDS (Intrusion Detection System) alerts  

A **Kibana-style dashboard** will be developed to visualize the data. Depending on progress, the project will also explore **ML/AI models** for anomaly detection and predictive analytics.

## üë• Team Members and Roles
All team members are actively involved in coding and implementation. Responsibilities are distributed as follows to ensure coverage of all project components:

- **Team Lead / Backend & Integration Developer**  
  Coordinates the project, manages repository and documentation, and develops backend services for data collection and integration with IoT devices.  

- **IoT Environment Developer**  
  Sets up physical/simulated IoT devices, configures sensors/firmware, and ensures proper device-to-network communication.  

- **Data & Logging Developer**  
  Implements log collection pipelines (sensor data, network activity, IDS logs), and prepares datasets for analysis.  

- **Visualization Developer**  
  Builds the Kibana-style dashboard for real-time visualization of IoT activity and security alerts.  

- **ML/AI Developer (Stretch Goal)**  
  Implements machine learning models for anomaly detection and predictive analytics if scope allows.
